# myMovieWatchlist
This is my implementation of a CRUD application. With this web application a user creates a list item and within a list item a user then creates a movie item, that is associated with the list. All items and their data is readable, editable and deletable.

## Technologies Used <a name="technologiesused"></a>
This application is a ASP.NET Core MVC Web Applcation with an Azure Database, deployed on Azure App Services.
* ASP.NET
* C#
* Git
* Azure MySQL Database
* Azure App Service
* Azure DevOps
* Trello

## Development <a name="development"></a>

### Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
* List Item
    * Create List
    * View Lists
    * Edit List
    * Delete List
    * Add Movie to List
* Movie Item 
    * Create Movie
    * View Movies in List
    * Edit Movie
    * Delete Movie
### User Stories <a name="userstories"></a>
* As a movie watcher, I want to be able to add movies to my movie watchlist, so that I can always have something to watch.

* As a movie watcher, I want to be able to edit or delete a movie I added to my movie watchlist, so that if I make any mistakes or change my mind it doesn't require much effort.

* As a movie watcher, I want to know if I have watched a movie or not, so that I can remember all the movies I want to watch and can look back on what I have already watched.

* As a user, I want a clean interface with no fuss, so that I can quickly and easily add/delete/edit/look at all the movies I have watched and want to watch.

### Trello Board <a name="trelloboard"></a>

## Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>
### Database <a name="database"></a>
#### Entity Relationship Diagram
The database changed once throughout development - with the addition of Year in Movie and the changing of typr for DateAdded to string from DateTime. There existsed a many-to-many relationship between list and movie so a third database was need in order to normalise the database. The MovieList table relates the two tables wihtout them relating to eachother.

#### Current Live Database
##### Lists

##### Movies
Through development the DateAdded attribute was changed from a DateTime to a string for displaying purposes.

### CI Pipeline <a name="ci"></a>
This was the aimed CI Pipeline implementation and nearly every aspect was a success, failing at the publish cycle in Azure Pipelines.

Unfortunately after publishing through Azure pipelines there is an error:
![CI Pipeline Error](./imgs/errorCI.PNG)
So I had to Publish through the Visual Studio publisher. 

## Risk Assesment <a name="risk"></a>

## Testing <a name="test"></a>
All controllers and models were tested using xUnit testing with a code coverage report generated by the extension Fine Code Coverage.

The testing of the models included:
* Null test
* Attribute tests
* Constructor test

The testing of the controllers included:
* Repositroy Patterns
* Mocking using Moq
* Controller Tests
* Null Test for each Function

Testing revealed issues I had in my code with poor exception handling. I fixed the issues with some simple conditional statements.

## Front-End <a name="frontend"></a>
When accessing the WebApp, the user is brought to the homepage that introduces the List CRUD functionailty. From the hompage, providing a list has been created, the user can navigate to the list page where all movies associated with the list are displayed.

## Issues and Improvements <a name="issues"></a>
### Issues
Issues I see:
* Not Publish Through Pipelines: As I couldn't get publishing through pipelines to work, there could be some long term CI/CD issues.
* Back Button Functionality: When using Chrome back buttons, after a delete for example, the same page is re-loaded making for a poor user experience. I added functioning back buttons to each page as a quick-fix but would like to work on a more robust solution.
* Redundant Data in Database: When adding movies there is no check to see if the movie added, already exists. While this is not a threat to the WebApp it is not the most ideal solution.

### Improvements
I would like to improve:
* The UI: Add some more unique features and styling ad it is currently quite basic.
* The Input: Ideally I would like to have the input areas as a partial view within the same page so the user isn't navigating between seperate pages.
* Edit of Movies: I would like to make the movie item editable within the movie view page, with the watched attribute like a radio button immitating a checklist.
* Add Publish Through Azure Pipelines.

### Additional Features
I would like to add:
* All Movie Feature: At the moment movies are only viewable within a list. I would like to add functionality to see all of the users added movies in one view.
    * This would reveal additional issues with how movies are added to the database, as a movie is added without checking if that movie item already exists. That would need to be updated.
* Add Movie Information: It would be nice to have each movie to have a movie page, like the likes of IMDB, with photo, actor and director information.
* A lot more Styling: I would like to add a lot more styling to the page.
* Accounts: Ideally the WebApp would work best with each using having their own account as to have their own database.
